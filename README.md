# Applied Econometrics Problem Sets

This repository contains five problem sets completed as part of a course on **Applied Econometrics**. Each problem set is designed to apply econometric techniques to real-world datasets, covering a range of topics such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, demand curve estimation, and time series analysis. The repository includes detailed R/Python/Stata code and markdown files that demonstrate the application of econometric theory to practical problems.

## Problem Sets Overview

1. **Problem Set 1: Calculating Conditional Distributions**
    - **Objective:** Write functions to calculate conditional distributions and analyze the relationship between education levels and wage outcomes.
    - **Key Topics:** 
        - Simulating data using uniform distributions.
        - Assigning education levels based on probability distributions.
        - Calculating mean and variance of wages based on education and skill levels.
    - **Techniques:** Data simulation, OLS estimation, conditional distribution functions.

2. **Problem Set 2: Hypothesis Testing and Regression Analysis**
    - **Objective:** Perform hypothesis testing and simple regression analysis using economic data.
    - **Key Topics:** 
        - T-tests, F-tests for significance testing.
        - Analyzing regression outputs and determining statistical significance.
        - Interpreting coefficients and applying econometric theory to explain results.
    - **Techniques:** Hypothesis testing, regression models, inference.
    - **Note:** This problem set primarily contains written work and analysis in PDF form.

3. **Problem Set 3: (Placeholder) Panel Data Analysis**
    - **Objective:** Analyze panel data to assess unobserved heterogeneity using fixed and random effects models.
    - **Key Topics:** Fixed effects, random effects, Hausman test.
    - **Techniques:** Estimating models with panel data, conducting robustness checks, testing for consistency across different model specifications.
    - **Status:** (Pending upload)

4. **Problem Set 4: Recovering the Demand Curve**
    - **Objective:** Use economic data to estimate a demand curve and perform conditional expectation analysis.
    - **Key Topics:** 
        - Conditional expectations of demand given price ranges.
        - Estimating demand curves and visualizing results using ggplot2.
        - Merging datasets to assess the impact of advertising on demand.
    - **Techniques:** Data manipulation with `data.table`, conditional expectation functions, data visualization with `ggplot2`.

5. **Problem Set 5: Central Limit Theorem and Sampling Distribution**
    - **Objective:** Explore the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and examine how sampling distributions evolve with sample size.
    - **Key Topics:** 
        - Sampling from populations and calculating sample means.
        - Demonstrating the strong law of large numbers and its implications.
        - Visualizing sampling distributions and their convergence to normality.
    - **Techniques:** Data simulation, histogram plotting using `ggplot2`, sampling with replacement, verifying statistical laws.

## Software and Tools

- **R/Python:** Used for statistical analysis, regression modeling, and data visualization.
- **ggplot2:** Employed for visualizing demand curves and sampling distributions.
- **data.table:** Utilized for efficient data manipulation and conditional calculations.
- **Stata:** Primarily used in Problem Set 2 for hypothesis testing and simple regressions.

## How to Run the Code

Each problem set is self-contained in its own directory, with all necessary code and data files included. To run the analysis:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aidanlynde/applied-econometrics.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the relevant problem set directory.
3. Open the R/Python/Stata files in your preferred environment and run the scripts.
